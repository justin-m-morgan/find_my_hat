# Find My Hat

## Introduction

This is a game about navigating a field, looking for your dropped hat ( ^ ). But don't fall in the holes (O) that scatter the landscape.

Movement commands are issued using the "w", "s", "a", and "d" (w: '⇡', s: '⇣', a: '⇠', d: '⇢',). Move your character ( \* ) about the map,
to find your hat.

**Note**: The map "wraps", such that you can leave the left side of the board and enter the right side of the board (or top/bottom similarly).

## Instructions

This is a node program, and as such you must have node installed on your system. With this in place, you can clone the repo using your preferred method. From within the directory of this repo:

`node ./index.js`

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by a portfolio project assignment on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com).
